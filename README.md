<h1>Conversational AI and Chatbot Using Amazon Lex</h1>
<h4>We will follow the steps to build a fully functional ChatBot using AWS Lex and then we ill proceed to website integration hosted on S3 and Slack integration</h4>
<p>But before we dive into the projects I would like to take a moment to explain what is AWS Lex.<br>
 <br>
 Amazon Lex is a fully managed artificial intelligence (AI) service with advanced natural language models to design, build, test, and deploy conversational interfaces, or commonly known as ChatBots, in applications. <br>
 Powered by the same technology as Alexa for speech recognition and language understanding; it integrates with with AWS Lambda which you trigger functions for execution and validations.<br>
 Once built, your bot can be deployed directly to chat platforms, mobile clients, and IoT devices
